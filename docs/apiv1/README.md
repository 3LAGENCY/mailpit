# API v1

Mailpit provides a simple REST API to access and delete stored messages.

If the Mailpit server is set to use Basic Authentication, then API requests must use Basic Authentication too.

The API is split into three main parts:

- [Messages](Messages.md) - Listing, deleting & marking messages as read/unread.
- [Message](Message.md) - Return message data & attachments
- [Tags](Tags.md) - Set message tags
- [Search](Search.md) - Searching messages
